# Supervised Learning

**Supervised learning** is a branch of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. This means that for each input in the training data, the corresponding correct output (label) is also provided. The goal is for the algorithm to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can be used to predict results on unseen data.

It’s called *“supervised”* because the learning process is guided by the known labels — much like a student learning from a teacher.

## Why Is It Important?

Supervised learning is foundational to most practical AI applications. It enables:
- Accurate predictions based on past data
- Pattern recognition and decision-making
- Automation of repetitive decision-based tasks

It’s the **most widely used** form of machine learning in industry today due to its effectiveness and wide range of use cases.


## Common Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
