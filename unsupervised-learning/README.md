# Unsupervised Learning

## What is Unsupervised Learning?

**Unsupervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is given input data **without labeled responses**. The goal is to explore the structure or distribution of the data and find hidden patterns or groupings without prior guidance.

In contrast to supervised learning, there are no "correct answers" — the model discovers the patterns on its own.

## Why Is It Important?

Unsupervised learning is essential when:
- You have **lots of data but no labels**
- You want to understand the **structure** of your data
- You're performing **exploratory data analysis**
- You're automating tasks like grouping or dimensionality reduction

It helps **reveal insights** in raw data and often serves as a **precursor to supervised learning**.


## Common Algorithms

- **Clustering**
  - K-Means
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN

- **Dimensionality Reduction**
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  - Autoencoders (in deep learning)
